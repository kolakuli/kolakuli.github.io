<h2 id="about-this-site">About this Site</h2>

<p>This is a static site powered by Jekyll. The design was done by me and the theme is freely available on <a href="https://github.com/olakara/JekyllMetro">Github</a>. I have used Bootstrap, jQuery, icons from Metro Studio of Syncfusion and Github for hosting the site.</p>

<p>Technicals apart, this is my personal site where I plan to pen down my thoughts, technical experiences that I would like to share. But, the content and opnion that you see here are personal and not related to companies / clients i work with. And regarding the code you see there.. you may use it as per your discretion.</p>

<h2 id="about-this-theme">About this Theme</h2>

<p>Jekyll Metro is the result of wanting a clean and new theme for my personal site. I was initially inspired by the <a href="https://github.com/poole/hyde">Hyde theme</a>. but soon I was googling to see if there are any Metro inspired theme available.
Since, I couldn’t find one, I decided to built one for myself. One of the main goal of building my own theme was to have a modern responsive theme that looks good on mobile, tablet and desktop.</p>

<p>You are free to use or fork this theme. And any contribution to fixes of issues are welcome.</p>
